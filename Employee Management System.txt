Project Name: Employee Management System

Abstract: The Employee Management System project aims to modernize and enhance the existing employee information management system of an organization. 
The project is undertaken by bit Labs, with the objective of developing a comprehensive,java application to handle various employee-related use cases efficiently. 
The successful implementation of this project will potentially lead to additional contracts from the organization.

The Employee Management System will incorporate the following features:

Employee Registration:
The system allows for the addition of new employees by capturing their details, including name, age, gender, employee ID, contact information, address,
and date of joining.Each employee is assigned a unique ID for easy identification and retrieval of their information.


Real-time Employee List:
The system provides a dynamic and real-time display of the employee list, ensuring up-to-date information at any given time.
This feature allows users to view the entire list of employees currently associated with the organization.


Employee Details Lookup:
By using the unique employee ID or name, the system allows users to retrieve comprehensive details about a specific employee.
This feature provides quick access to important information such as personal details, job role, department, and contact information.



Filtering Employees:
The system offers the ability to filter and generate lists based on specific criteria.
Users can obtain a list of employees belonging to a particular city, state, or age group, facilitating targeted data retrieval and analysis.


Employee Recovery Status:
The system allows users to mark an employee as "recovered" when they return to normal work functions after a period of absence or illness.
This feature aids in tracking employee well-being and determining their availability for work-related responsibilities.

 

Employee Data Deletion:
Authorized users can delete an employee's information from the system when required.
This functionality ensures the proper management of employee data, including adhering to privacy regulations.


The implementation of the Employee Management System will utilize efficient data structures and concepts from object-oriented programming (OOP) using Java. The project will emphasize writing clean, organized, and modular code, employing appropriate objects and methods to ensure maintainability and scalability.
By successfully developing this system, the organization will benefit from a modernized employee management solution that enhances data organization, retrieval, and analysis, leading to improved efficiency in managing employee information and facilitating informed decision-making.
Implement these features using efficient data structures and OOP concepts learnt in the Java Foundation course. 

Write clean and organized codes using proper objects and methods.
